 REST Operator

REST operator is shown by (...dots) . It allows to represent any number of arguments as a array (packs all arguments in a array)
rest operators allow us to condense multiple elements into a single array 

In functions when we require to pass arguments but were not sure how many we have to pass, the rest parameter makes it easier

Rest operators are last in paramters list

function sum(a,...args){
  // //print sum
    console.log(args)
}
sum(3,4)
sum(3,4,5,5)
